# Course Title: Statistical Methods for High-throughput Genomics Data I

Instructor: Mikhail Dozmorov  
Department: Biostatistics, VCU  
Credits: 3   
Duration: 15 weeks (2 lectures per week, 1 hour 20 minutes each)

## Course Overview

<!-- This course introduces deep learning concepts using R, with hands-on exercises. The focus will be on implementing deep learning models and exploring various architectures using the "Deep Learning with R" textbook by François Chollet and J. J. Allaire. The course will cover both foundational and advanced topics in deep learning, including computer vision, natural language processing, and generative models. -->

Welcome to BIOS 658. This course is the first part of the Genomics curriculum, aimed to introduce core principles of Data Science, Genomics, Bioinformatics and Biostatistics. This is a blended course that combines in-class learning (lectures, labs) with self-directed activities.

Bioinformatics is interdisciplinary computer science, requiring a knowledge base in biology, technology, and statistics. The operational definition of ‘bioinformatics’ for this course is "The application of biotechnology and statistical methods to the study of biological problems." The biological problems on which we will focus are primarily gene expression studies conducted using RNA-seq technology.

The class will be conducted in person and include lecture and coding parts. Course material will be publicly available. The syllabus is subject to change.

# Class rules

* Attendance is required
* Read all assignments before class
* Bring your laptop and the book to every class

# Grading Rubric

## General Expectations (applies to all assignments)

When evaluating any assignment, the following points will be considered:

- **Punctuality and Completeness** – Was the assignment submitted on time and fully completed, addressing all required components?

- **Organization and Presentation** – Is the material presented clearly, logically, and in a format suitable for a professional/academic audience?

- **Effort and Application** – Does the work demonstrate serious engagement with the material and effective use of the required tools (e.g., R, RMarkdown, GitHub)?

## Discussions

- **Preparedness** – Student demonstrates they have completed the assigned preparation (videos, readings, tutorials) before class.

- **Participation** – Student is actively engaged during discussion (listening attentively, asking questions, contributing ideas, responding to peers).

## In-class Exercises

- **Effort** – Student makes a genuine attempt to complete the exercise and uses it as an opportunity to deepen understanding of the topic.

- **Collaboration** – When working with peers, the student contributes meaningfully to group progress.

## Final project

- In addition to the above grading considerations, each student will grade one peer's project, assigned randomly. The goal here is to learn from peer's work while assessing its quality. Grading by students will be averaged with instructor's grading.

In addition to the criteria above, the final project will be evaluated on:

- **Reproducibility** – The project must be reproducible, with clear instructions, well-documented code, and an organized GitHub repository.

- **Depth and Rigor** – The project should demonstrate mastery of statistical and computational methods in genomics, with thoughtful application to a real dataset or problem.

- **Communication** – Results and interpretations should be presented clearly, with effective use of figures, tables, and narrative.

- **Peer Review** – Each student will evaluate one randomly assigned peer’s project. Peer grades will be combined with the instructor’s grade. Peer evaluation should be constructive and based on the same rubric.

# Assignment Values

## Grading model

<!-- _includes/grading.md -->

Grading for individual assignments reflects the overall quality of the completed work:

* **A** – Excellent work demonstrating high quality, accuracy, and minimal need for revision.
* **B** – Good work showing solid understanding and competence, with minor issues.
* **C** – Satisfactory but below expectations; work has notable errors or omissions.
* **D** – Poor work that fails to meet basic standards or demonstrates significant misunderstandings.
* **F** – Unacceptable work with major deficiencies, showing little effort or understanding.

## Assignments Grade Overall

<!-- _includes/assignment-weight.md -->

Your final grade reflects your performance throughout the semester. It includes readings, participation, in-class exercises (attendance is required), and assignments, weighted as follows:

|            Assignment           | Percentage Value |
|---------------------------------|------------------|
|      In-class participation     |        20%       |
| Reading and homework assignment |        50%       |
|          Final project          |        30%       |
|              TOTAL              |       100%       |

## Deadlines policy

**Deadlines** are mandatory. Homework and reading assignment reviews are due **two weeks from the assignment date**, unless otherwise specified. Late submissions will receive no credit unless you discuss the situation with the instructor in advance.

Assignments must be submitted **before the stated deadline**. For each day an assignment is late, the grade will drop by **half a letter grade**. Plan ahead and remember: *done is better than perfect*—it is always better to submit something than nothing. If you encounter difficulties, notify the instructor immediately rather than waiting until it is too late. In return, you can expect feedback from the instructor within a reasonable timeframe.

## Plagiarism and Copyright

It is a **serious ethical violation** to take any material created by another person and represent it as your own original work. Any such plagiarism will result in **serious disciplinary action**, possibly including dismissal from VCU. Plagiarism can involve copying text from a book or magazine without proper attribution, or lifting words, code, photographs, videos, or other materials from the Internet and presenting them as your own. Please ask the instructor if you have any questions about distinguishing acceptable research from plagiarism.

In addition to being a serious academic issue, **copyright is also a legal matter**.

Never "lift," "borrow," "appropriate," or "repurpose" graphics, audio, or code without **both permission and proper attribution**. This guidance applies to scripts, audio, video clips, programs, photos, drawings, and other images, including those found online and in books.

Create your own graphics, seek out images that are in the **public domain** or shared via a **Creative Commons license** that allows derivative works, or use images from the **AP Photo Bank** or other sources for which the school has obtained licensing.

If you’re repurposing code, **keep the original licensing intact**. If you are unsure how to credit code, ask the instructor.

The **exception is fair use**: if your work analyzes or comments on the image itself, reproducing it may be acceptable. For more guidance on fair use, the **Citizen Media Law Project** is an excellent resource.

**When in doubt: ask.**
