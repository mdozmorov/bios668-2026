<h1>Course Title: Statistical Methods for High-throughput Genomics Data II</h1>
<p>Instructor: Mikhail Dozmorov<br />
Department: Biostatistics, VCU<br />
Credits: 3<br />
Duration: 15 weeks (2 lectures per week, 1 hour 20 minutes each)</p>
<div id="course-overview" class="section level2">
<h2>Course Overview</h2>
<p>Welcome to BIOS 668. This course is the second part of the Genomics curriculum, aimed to introduce core principles of Data Science, Genomics, Bioinformatics and Biostatistics. This is a blended course that combines in-class learning (lectures, labs) with self-directed activities.</p>
<p>The study of genomics and use of next-generation sequencing are at the forefront of biomedical research. Sequencing market is constantly evolving, stimulating the development of new genomics technologies, biostatistical approaches and software tools. Therefore it may not be possible to maintain a stable analysis pipeline throughout a project because the lifetime of software often spans months and even years. To be able to effectively analyze and interpret genomic sequencing data, it is crucial to (1) understand the technologies and statistical properties of the data they produce and (2) develop strong computational skills that will be competitive and broadly applicable.</p>
<p>This course is a continuation of the BIOS 658 and will introduce high-throughput genomic assays including single cell RNA-seq and spatial transcriptomics, whole genome sequencing, alignment, and genome variation analysis, miRNA-seq, metagenomics, epigenomic analysis including ChIP-seq and methylation assays, and chromatin conformation capture technologies. The course will develop applied skills for multi-omics data analysis using Unix, high-performance computing, and R environments. The course is primarily focusing on human genomics; however, knowledge and skills gained through the course are extendable on genomics of model organisms.</p>
<p>The class will be conducted in person and include lecture and coding parts. Course material will be publicly available. The syllabus is subject to change.

<h2>General Expectations (applies to all assignments)</h2>
<p>When evaluating any assignment, the following points will be considered:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Punctuality and Completeness</strong> – Was the assignment submitted on time and fully completed, addressing all required components?</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Organization and Presentation</strong> – Is the material presented clearly, logically, and in a format suitable for a professional/academic audience?</p></li>

</ul>
<p>In addition to the criteria above, the final project will be evaluated on:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Reproducibility</strong> – The project must be reproducible, with clear instructions, well-documented code, and an organized GitHub repository.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Depth and Rigor</strong> – The project should demonstrate mastery of statistical and computational methods in genomics, with thoughtful application to a real dataset or problem.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Communication</strong> – Results and interpretations should be presented clearly, with effective use of figures, tables, and narrative.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Peer Review</strong> – Each student will evaluate one randomly assigned peer’s project. Peer grades will be combined with the instructor’s grade. Peer evaluation should be constructive and based on the same rubric.</p></li>

<div id="deadlines-policy" class="section level2">
<h2>Deadlines policy</h2>
<p><strong>Deadlines</strong> are mandatory. Homework and reading assignment reviews are due <strong>two weeks from the assignment date</strong>, unless otherwise specified. Late submissions will receive no credit unless you discuss the situation with the instructor in advance.</p>
<p>Assignments must be submitted <strong>before the stated deadline</strong>. For each day an assignment is late, the grade will drop by <strong>half a letter grade</strong>. Plan ahead and remember: <em>done is better than perfect</em>—it is always better to submit something than nothing. If you encounter difficulties, notify the instructor immediately rather than waiting until it is too late. In return, you can expect feedback from the instructor within a reasonable timeframe.</p>

<div id="plagiarism-and-copyright" class="section level2">
<h2>Plagiarism and Copyright</h2>
<p>It is a <strong>serious ethical violation</strong> to take any material created by another person and represent it as your own original work. Any such plagiarism will result in <strong>serious disciplinary action</strong>, possibly including dismissal from VCU. Plagiarism can involve copying text from a book or magazine without proper attribution, or lifting words, code, photographs, videos, or other materials from the Internet and presenting them as your own. Please ask the instructor if you have any questions about distinguishing acceptable research from plagiarism.</p>
<p>In addition to being a serious academic issue, <strong>copyright is also a legal matter</strong>.</p>
<p>Never “lift,” “borrow,” “appropriate,” or “repurpose” graphics, audio, or code without <strong>both permission and proper attribution</strong>. This guidance applies to scripts, audio, video clips, programs, photos, drawings, and other images, including those found online and in books.</p>
<p>Create your own graphics, seek out images that are in the <strong>public domain</strong> or shared via a <strong>Creative Commons license</strong> that allows derivative works, or use images from the <strong>AP Photo Bank</strong> or other sources for which the school has obtained licensing.</p>
<p>If you’re repurposing code, <strong>keep the original licensing intact</strong>. If you are unsure how to credit code, ask the instructor.</p>
<p>The <strong>exception is fair use</strong>: if your work analyzes or comments on the image itself, reproducing it may be acceptable. For more guidance on fair use, the <strong>Citizen Media Law Project</strong> is an excellent resource.</p>
<p><strong>When in doubt: ask.</strong></p>
