BIOS 668. Statistical Methods for High-throughput Genomics Data II. 3 Hours.  

Semester course; 3 lecture hours. 3 credits. Prerequisites: BIOS 658.

This course is a continuation of the BIOS 658 and will introduce high-throughput genomic assays including single cell RNA-seq and spatial transcriptomics, whole genome sequencing, alignment, and genome variation analysis, miRNA-seq, metagenomics, epigenomic analysis including ChIP-seq and methylation assays, and chromatin conformation capture technologies. The course will develop applied skills for multi-omics data analysis using Unix, high-performance computing, and R environments. The course is primarily focusing on human genomics; however, knowledge and skills gained through the course are extendable on genomics of model organisms.

Use Hugo, Markdown. Implement the front page and make menu entries for the syllabus, schedule, classes with class-specific pages listed in the left scroll panel. Individual class pages should be linkable to entries in the schedule. Class pages should link to the Xaringan lecture slides. Create example pages for each page, and for a couple of class pages and lectures. Add anything else that is typically included in course websites. Create individual files that I can download and put in a GitHub repository to serve on GitHub pages.
