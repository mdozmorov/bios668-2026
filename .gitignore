## Hugo build output
# The 'public' directory is where Hugo generates the static site files.
# It should be ignored and regenerated by Hugo/Netlify/GitHub Pages/etc.
# Note: Blogdown/RStudio may use 'public' as the default output dir.

# Dependencies/external files
# Depending on your setup, you might want to ignore the 'libs' directory
# if it contains generated or temporary files (e.g., from R/Blogdown).
# If 'libs' contains important source files, remove this line.

# If you use the 'themes' directory as a submodule, don't ignore it.
# If you copied/modified the theme files directly, you might still want
# to track them, but it's good practice to use Git submodules or Hugo Modules.

# Example files you might want to track, but if they are large or temporary,
# consider adding them here.
